      <h1>Chaco Plain Retroarc Foreland Basin of South America</h1>
      <h3>A textbook example of a Distributive Fluvial System</h3>
      <p>Dr. Gary Weissmann, a professor of hydrology at the University of New Mexico, has studied fluvial systems for a majority of the past two decades.
           As an undergraduate student under his advisement, I have been conducting research examining the Chaco Plain in South America to understand the 
          geomorphic, fluvial, and sedimentary characteristics of this region.</p>
