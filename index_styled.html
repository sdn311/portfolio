		<h1>My Geography 485L/585L Home Page</h1>
		<p>My name is Stephen Newman, and I am a senior at the University of New Mexico.  
			I am studying Earth and Planetary Sciences with a minor in Geographic Information Systems.
			I like ridin' colts, punchin' cows, and chasin' wild women. </p>
		
		<p>I'm taking this course on the road to completing my college degree, and expect to learn more than I ever thought I would know about web building.</p>
