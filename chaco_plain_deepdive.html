      <h1>Chaco Plain Retroarc Foreland Basin of South America:</h1>
      <h3>A textbook example of a Distributive Fluvial System</h3>
        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        <p>Dr. Gary Weissmann, a professor of hydrology at the University of New Mexico, has studied fluvial systems for a majority of the past two decades.
         As an undergraduate student under his advisement, I have been conducting research examining the Chaco Plain in South America to understand the 
         geomorphic, fluvial, and sedimentary characteristics of this region.</p>
        <h5>Purpose</h5>
        <p>The purpose of this web map is too show the Chaco Plain Retroare Foreland Basin of South America, a depression in the
           Earth's crust that formed from a collision between the Nazca Plate (oceanic) and the South American Plate (continental).
           The subducting Nazca plate is causing the South American Plate to bulge up near the plate margin, and to flex downward
           away from the margin.  This downward flexure is what created the Chaco Plain Basin.
        <p>The Chaco Plain basin is the topic of my undergraduate research because of the fluvial systems that are present in the basin,
           systems that have been called Distributive Fluvial Systems (DFS) by Dr. Gary Weissmann in many papers published in academic journals.
           These systems contain alluvial fans which are features that result from erosion of high features such as mountains by rainwater 
           collecting in drainage basins and flowing out at a point known as the fan apex.  The fan extends away from the mountain-front in a gentle
           sloping, conical manner.  These systems are named as such because the rivers therein tend to decrease in discharge with distance from the 
           fan apex because of ground infiltration and evaporation of the water within the channels.  Channel bifurcation also contributes to a decrease
           in a streams discharge.
